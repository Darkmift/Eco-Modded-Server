    - [Citizenship] - Citizens may be granted special rights and privileges, and being a citizen of a settlement increases its power.
    - [Influence] - Settlements will cast an influence in a radius around certain buildings within which laws and property rules are enforced.
    - [Settlement Property] - The more citizens in a settlement, the more property can be claimed.
    - [Culture] - Culture allows settlements to exert influence on neighboring settlements, which can lead to their annexation.
    - [Annexation] - Settlements can take over other settlements or homesteads if their culture levels are high enough.
    - [Property Crisis] - If a settlement loses citizens, it may not be able to maintain the property that is already claimed.
